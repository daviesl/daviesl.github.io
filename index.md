# About
I'm a postdoctorate research associate at the University of New South Wales. I'm under the supervision of [Professor Scott Sisson](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/scott-sisson).

I was a PhD candidate at the Queensland University of Technology, under the supervision of [Professor Chris Drovandi](https://chrisdrovandi.weebly.com/), [Dr Matt Sutton](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/staff/matthew-sutton/), and [Dr Gentry White](https://www.qut.edu.au/about/our-people/academic-profiles/gentry.white).

My research topics of interest are sequential Monte Carlo, reversible Jump MCMC, and normalizing flows. My most recent work, [Transport Reversible Jump Proposals](research.md) looks at how flows can be applied to enhance RJMCMC.
